write a c++ program to store roll number of students in array who attended training program in random order.write code for searching whether particular student attend  training program or not using linear search.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a[10],n,i,flag=0,num;
    cout<<"number of student who attend training program";
    cin>>n;
    cout<<"enter roll number of student who attended training program";
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        cin>>a[i];
    }
    cout<<"enter roll number to search";
    cin>>num;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(num==a[i])
        {
            flag=1;
            break;
        }
    }
    if(flag==1)
    {
        cout<<"program attended by student";
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"program not attended by student";
    }
    return 0;
}
